Weâ€™re going to use the logistic growth function to model the percentage of American with cell phone service (The World Bank, 2013).
![Table for lab 1](Lab1fig.png)

## Exercise 1

Use the commands you have learned to plot the number of Americans with cell phone service from 1995 to 2012. On the $x$-axis, start with 1995 as year 0.
```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  x = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17),
  y = c(12.69, 16.35, 20.29, 25.09, 30.81, 38.75, 45.00, 49.16, 55.15, 62.852, 68.63, 76.64, 82.47, 85.68, 89.14, 91.86, 95.28, 98.17)
)

scatter_plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Americans with cell phones",
       x = "year (starting 1995)",
       y = "americans with cell phones (%)")

print(scatter_plot)
```

## Exercise 2

Given the initial value $N_0$, intrinsic growth parameter $r$, and carrying capacity $B$, the logistic model is
\[N(t) = \dfrac{N_0 B}{N_0 + (B-N_0)e^{-rt}}\]
What are reasonable choices for $N_0$ and $B$? Why?
Create variables N0 and B to reflect your choices.
```{r}
N_0 = 12.69
B = 100

print("12.69 is a good N_0 value because in 1995 (year 0), the percent coverage starts at 12.69%")
print("100 is a good carrying capacity because the highest % coverage possible is full, 100% coverage")
```


## Exercise 3

Plot the logistic function on the same graph as the previous data using the \texttt{lines} function, in various colors (or line types), with $r=0.25,0.27,0.29,0.31$. Which is the best fit for the data?
```{r}
r_values = c(0.25, 0.27, 0.29, 0.31)

x_seq <- seq(0, 17, by = 0.1)

logistic_model <- function(x_seq, r_val){(N_0*B)/(N_0 + (B-N_0)*exp(-r_val*x_seq))}


logistic_data <- data.frame()

for (r_val in r_values) {
  y_values <- logistic_model(x_seq, r_val)
  logistic_data <- rbind(logistic_data, data.frame(x = x_seq, y = y_values, r_value = as.character(r_val)))
}


final_plot <- scatter_plot +
  geom_line(data = logistic_data, aes(x = x, y = y, color = r_value), size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Americans with cell phones",
       x = "year (starting 1995)",
       y = "americans with cell phones (%)")

print(final_plot)

#0.29 seems like the best r value
```

## Exercise 4

Using your model, what percentage of Americans are expected to have cell service in 2013?
```{r}
predicted_2013 = logistic_model(18, 0.29)
print(predicted_2013)
```
